# SimpleStorage in Solidity | Created by csomi2409

Contains 1 program (``SimpleStorage.py``)

A Storage contract that I created based on the Lecture of Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course â€“ Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial on Youtube by FreeCodeCamp.org.

You can `store` a FavouriteNumber and `retrieve` it by calling the function.

You can also store names and the people's favourite number. You can call His/Her favourite number and name by putting the index in the `people` tab.
